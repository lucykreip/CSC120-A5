- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think that association gave me a generally good idea of where to anchor certain methods in each of the classes, and what the affect is of having these methods in these different "locations". It was though what I think I had the most difficulty with, with how to associate everything together in the train class, and how to make it all associate and run, literally. I think I need to better envision exactly how the different classes will all work together when they run and in the Train class, so that I can more effectively code the  final bits that associate everything.
